Setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. Servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.

This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. If objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned.

    Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
    
    The serialization format is:
    
    <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
      (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
    <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
      (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
    <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
      (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
    <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
    
    No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
    
    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
    
    Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
    The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
    
    Examples:
      1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
      1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
    
    Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
    
    Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
    
    This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

    <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
    
    No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
    
    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.

    <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
    
    No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
    
    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
    
    Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
    The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
    
    Examples:
      1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
      1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
    
    Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

    """
  averageValue:String
  """
    Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
    
    The serialization format is:
    
    <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
      (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
    <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
      (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
    <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
      (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
    <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
    
    No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
    
    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
    
    Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
    The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
    
    Examples:
      1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
      1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
    
    Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
    
    Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
    
    This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

    Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
    
    The serialization format is:
    
    <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
      (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
    <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
      (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
    <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
      (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
    <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
    
    No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
    
    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
    
    Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
    The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
    
    Examples:
      1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
      1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
    
    Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
    
    Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
    
    This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.

    Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.
    
    The serialization format is:
    
    <quantity>        ::= <signedNumber><suffix>
      (Note that <suffix> may be empty, from the "" case in <decimalSI>.)
    <digit>           ::= 0 | 1 | ... | 9 <digits>          ::= <digit> | <digit><digits> <number>          ::= <digits> | <digits>.<digits> | <digits>. | .<digits> <sign>            ::= "+" | "-" <signedNumber>    ::= <number> | <sign><number> <suffix>          ::= <binarySI> | <decimalExponent> | <decimalSI> <binarySI>        ::= Ki | Mi | Gi | Ti | Pi | Ei
      (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
    <decimalSI>       ::= m | "" | k | M | G | T | P | E
      (Note that 1024 = 1Ki but 1000 = 1k; I didn't choose the capitalization.)
    <decimalExponent> ::= "e" <signedNumber> | "E" <signedNumber>
    
    No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.
    
    When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.
    
    Before serializing, Quantity will be put in "canonical form". This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
      a. No precision is lost
      b. No fractional digits will be emitted
      c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
    The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.
    
    Examples:
      1.5 will be serialized as "1500m"
      1.5Gi will be serialized as "1536Mi"
    
    Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.
    
    Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don't diff.)
    
    This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.
